- In Overall, The relationship between Boat Price and Views :
  - Higher boat price does not mean that attract great attention of viewers.
  - Customer focus their attention on Boat Lower than 150k Europe types, especially 50k Europe.
  - Although higher 1 million Europe type of boat have average rate than 150k to 1million, but I guest that customer are just curious about these super boats instead of having serious buying purpose.

- Boat made by GRP material is significantly hot in the current market with over 70% of total market boat material
- Some super boat with price over higher 1million Europe choose GRP as its core material.

# 7. Final Comments

- It can be seen that Udemy in 7 years (2011-2017) has had a fairly stable development.
  - Expanded many different courses with a variety of fields.
  - More paid courses have been opened. Increase both quality and quantity.
  - Students are willing to pay more for classes on Udemy
  - Web Development courses and All Level courses are always the most popular and profitable courses for Udemy.

- However, the first two quarters of 2017 saw a significant setback compared to the same period last year. The reason may lie in the quality of the courses that did not meet the needs of the students, the courses were copied and sold on other platforms. Or it can also be due to the strong development of other platforms Eg: Coursera.

- ðŸš© So, I believe that Udemy should:
  - Focus more on quality courses in other subjects to expand the student population. Change and update learning difficulties with better quality, update knowledge.
  - Continue to strengthen the foundation of Web Development courses. Especially about the development trend of science and technology, Udemy should open more courses on Computer Technology and Data.
