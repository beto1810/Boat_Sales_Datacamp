- In Overall, The relationship between Boat Price and Views :
  - Higher boat price does not mean that attract great attention of viewers.
  - Customer focus their attention on Boat Lower than 150k Europe types, especially 50k Europe.
  - Although higher 1 million Europe type of boat have average rate than 150k to 1million, but I guest that customer are just curious about these super boats instead of having serious buying purpose.

# 4. Material

- Boat made by GRP material is significantly hot in the current market with over 70% of total market boat material
- Some super boat with price over higher 1million Europe choose GRP as its core material. 

-> GRP is lighter and stronger and Itâ€™s easier for boat owners to repair boats.

# 5. Condition and Engine

- Condition :
  - Used boat accounts for majority of total listed on website.
  - New condition boat also receive attention of consumer as you can see here, there no much significant different of avarage view between 3 type of boatâ€™s condition

-> Used boat got a little bit more attractive by it got advantage of price than new boat

- Engine : Boat use diesel and Unleaded engine are most popurlar type

- The top locations are Switzerland, Germany, and Italy
- People of these countries likely to choose boat under 150k$.

-> There are many lakes inside these countries, people love sailing their boats and enjoy the scenes.

# 7. Conclusion & Recommendation

- In Last 7 days, Nearly New Nautical Website has experienced some significant numbers as:
  - Nearly New Nautical Website had 1.4 millions of views and about 10,000 boats posted.
  - Top 3 Boat Type by views are Motor Yacht, Sport Boat, Cabin Boat.
  - High price boat does not attract viewers instead of Low price boat.
  - GRP is the most popular material of boat.
  - Diesel and Unleaded Engine boat account for more than 98% of total boat.
  - Europe countries, especially Switzerland got the highest amount of boat listed on website.



- ðŸš© So, I believe that Nearly New Nautical Website should:
  - Design Special Newsletter base on top countries like Switzerland, Germany, Italy or they can consider have special sections relating to top countries as their landscape, lake, river, beach etc.
  - Recommend some top manufacturer and have interview with management teams of these manufacturers.
  - With sales section, newsletter should give some useful insight to boat owners relating type of boat, price, material.
  - Thinking about broadening market to North America.
